## Introduction

The `services` directory contains individual microservices that collectively make up the backend of the Brewhub application. Each microservice focuses on a specific domain, allowing for isolation and scalability of functionalities.

## Benefits of Microservices

- **Modularity**: Microservices allow for the independent development, deployment, and scaling of different components of the application.
- **Scalability**: Each microservice can be scaled independently based on its specific requirements, leading to better resource utilization.
- **Flexibility**: Technologies and frameworks can be chosen based on the specific needs of each microservice.
- **Isolation**: A failure in one microservice does not necessarily impact the entire application, enhancing fault tolerance.

## gRPC Integration

The Brewhub microservices communicate with each other using gRPC, a high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework. gRPC facilitates efficient communication between services, allowing them to exchange data and invoke methods in a language-agnostic way.

### How gRPC Works

1. **Protocol Buffers (ProtoBuf)**: gRPC uses Protocol Buffers for defining the service methods and message types. This allows for easy serialization and deserialization of data.

2. **HTTP/2**: gRPC utilizes HTTP/2 as its transport protocol. This enables features like multiplexing, header compression, and flow control, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced latency.

3. **Code Generation**: gRPC generates client and server code based on the service definition. This makes it easy to develop and maintain consistent interfaces between services.

### Advantages of Using gRPC

- **Efficiency**: gRPC is designed for high-performance communication. It uses binary serialization, which is more compact and faster than JSON or XML, making it ideal for microservices.

- **Language Agnostic**: gRPC supports multiple programming languages, allowing different microservices to be implemented in the language that best suits their requirements.

- **Streaming Support**: gRPC supports both unary (single request, single response) and streaming (multiple requests or responses) communication patterns, providing flexibility for different use cases.

- **Strong Typing with ProtoBuf**: The use of Protocol Buffers ensures strong typing of messages and RPC methods, reducing the chances of runtime errors and improving code reliability.

- **Bi-directional Communication**: gRPC allows for full-duplex communication, meaning both the client and server can independently initiate calls, enabling real-time interactions.

- **Automatic Load Balancing and Service Discovery**: gRPC integrates well with tools like Kubernetes and Consul, making it easier to manage microservices in a dynamic environment.

By utilizing gRPC for communication between microservices, Brewhub benefits from a robust, efficient, and language-agnostic solution that helps streamline inter-service communication, leading to a more scalable and maintainable system.

## Authentication Service

### Function

The Authentication Service is responsible for handling user authentication and authorization. It manages user sessions, authentication tokens, and ensures secure access to protected routes.

### Usage

To utilize the Authentication Service, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the authentication service directory:

   ```bash
   cd services/auth-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the authentication service:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Menu Service

### Function

The Menu Service manages the coffee product catalog, allowing for the addition, editing, and deletion of products. It also handles categorization for better organization.

### Usage

To use the Menu Service, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the menu service directory:

   ```bash
   cd services/menu-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the menu service:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## User Service

### Function

The User Service is responsible for user management. It handles user registration, login, and profile information.

### Usage

To utilize the User Service, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the user service directory:

   ```bash
   cd services/user-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the user service:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Order Service

### Function

The Order Service facilitates the creation and management of orders. It allows users to place orders and view their order history, while admins can view and process all orders.

### Usage

To use the Order Service, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the order service directory:

   ```bash
   cd services/order-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the order service:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Admin Service

### Function

The Admin Service provides administrative functionalities. Admins can manage products and view all orders for better oversight.

### Usage

To utilize the Admin Service, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the admin service directory:

   ```bash
   cd services/admin-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the admin service:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
