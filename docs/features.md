To build a comprehensive application with the mentioned features, you would typically divide your application into multiple microservices to follow a microservices architecture. Here's a breakdown of potential microservices and their functions:

**1. User Service:**
   - **User Registration:** Handles user registration by creating user accounts.
   - **User Authentication:** Manages user authentication, including login and token generation.
   - **User Profiles:** Stores and retrieves user profile information.
   - **User Management:** Provides functionality for updating user information, addresses, and payment methods.
   - **User Reviews:** Stores and retrieves user-generated reviews and ratings.

   - **Menu Management:** Manages menu items, including adding, updating, and deleting items.
   - **Menu Listing:** Provides menu listings with categories and search functionality.
   - **Item Images:** Stores and serves images for menu items.
   - **Item Availability:** Manages the availability status of menu items.

**3. Order Service:**

Each of these microservices should have its own database or data store tailored to its specific needs. Additionally, communication between microservices can be done through APIs or message queues, depending on your architecture preferences.

Remember that microservices architecture aims to improve scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, but it also introduces complexity. Ensure proper testing, monitoring, and security measures are in place, and consider containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes to manage and scale your microservices effectively.
